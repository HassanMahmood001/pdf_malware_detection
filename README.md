Malware detection in pdfs using machine learning

The model.py files is used for training, testing and validating the ML model using KNN, SVM and decision tree algorithms.

The SVM_GridSearchCV.py file is used for training, testing and validating the machine learning model using SVM algorithm, 
GridSearchCV function is used for the parameter tuning of the model and the best SVM parameters are then used to train, test 
and validate the model. 

requirements.txt contains a list of all the libraries required by the programs to run.
